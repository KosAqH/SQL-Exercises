1. List the owners (name and address) of Vehicles caught by camera 1 or 18 without duplication.

SELECT DISTINCT keeper.name, keeper.address
FROM keeper
JOIN vehicle ON vehicle.keeper = keeper.id
JOIN image ON image.reg = vehicle.id
WHERE camera = 1 OR camera = 18

2. Show keepers (name and address) who have more than 5 vehicles.

SELECT keeper.name, keeper.address
FROM keeper
JOIN vehicle ON vehicle.keeper = keeper.id
GROUP BY keeper.name, keeper.address
HAVING  COUNT(*) > 5

3. For each vehicle show the number of current permits (suppose today is the 1st of Feb 2007). The list should include the vehicle.s registration and the number of permits. Current permits can be determined based on charge types, e.g. for weekly permit you can use the date after 24 Jan 2007 and before 02 Feb 2007.

SELECT reg, SUM( 
CASE
    WHEN permit.chargeType = 'Daily' AND permit.sDate = '2007-02-01' THEN 1
    WHEN permit.chargeType = 'Weekly' AND permit.sDate BETWEEN '2007-01-25' AND '2007-02-01' THEN 1
    WHEN permit.chargeType = 'Monthly' AND permit.sDate BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2007-02-01' THEN 1
    WHEN permit.chargeType = 'Annualy' AND permit.sDate BETWEEN '2006-02-01' AND '2007-02-01' THEN 1
ELSE 0
END) as n_current_permits
FROM permit

GROUP BY reg

4. Obtain a list of every vehicle passing camera 10 on 25th Feb 2007. Show the time, the registration and the name of the keeper if available.

SELECT image.whn, image.reg, keeper.name
FROM image
JOIN vehicle ON image.reg = vehicle.id
JOIN keeper ON vehicle.keeper = keeper.id 
WHERE DATE(image.whn) = '2007-02-25' AND image.camera = 10

5. List the keepers who have more than 4 vehicles and one of them must have more than 2 permits. The list should include the names and the number of vehicles.

SELECT keeper.name, COUNT(vehicle.id)
FROM keeper
JOIN vehicle ON vehicle.keeper = keeper.id
JOIN permit ON permit.reg = vehicle.id
WHERE vehicle.id IN (
  SELECT permit.reg
  FROM permit
  GROUP BY permit.reg
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
)
GROUP BY keeper.name
HAVING COUNT(vehicle.id) > 4
