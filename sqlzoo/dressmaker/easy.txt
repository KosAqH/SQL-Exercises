1. List the post code, order number, order date and garment descriptions for all items associated with Ms Brown.

SELECT jmcust.c_post_code, dress_order.order_no, dress_order.order_date, garment.description
FROM jmcust

JOIN dress_order ON jmcust.c_no = dress_order.cust_no
JOIN order_line ON dress_order.order_no = order_line.order_ref
JOIN quantities ON ol_style = quantities.style_q AND ol_size=size_q
JOIN garment ON quantities.style_q = garment.style_no

WHERE jmcust.c_name = 'Ms Brown'

2. List the customer name, postal information, order date and order number of all orders that have been completed.

SELECT jmcust.c_name, jmcust.c_post_code, dress_order.order_no, dress_order.order_date 
FROM jmcust
JOIN dress_order ON jmcust.c_no = dress_order.cust_no
JOIN order_line ON dress_order.order_no = order_line.order_ref
WHERE completed = 'Y'

3. Which garments have been made or are being made from 'red abstract' or 'blue abstract' coloured materials.

SELECT garment.description, material.colour
FROM garment

JOIN quantities ON quantities.style_q = garment.style_no
JOIN order_line ON ol_style = quantities.style_q AND order_line.ol_size=quantities.size_q
JOIN material ON order_line.ol_material = material.material_no

WHERE material.colour = 'red abstract' OR material.colour = 'blue abstract' 

4. How many garments has each dressmaker constructed? You should give the number of garments and the name and postal information of each dressmaker.

SELECT dressmaker.d_name, dressmaker.d_post_code, COUNT(*)
FROM dressmaker

JOIN construction ON dressmaker.d_no = construction.maker
JOIN order_line ON construction.order_ref = order_line.order_ref AND construction.line_ref = order_line.line_no

GROUP BY d_name, d_post_code

5. Give the names of those dressmakers who have finished items made from silk for completed orders.

SELECT DISTINCT dressmaker.d_name
FROM dressmaker

JOIN construction ON dressmaker.d_no = construction.maker
JOIN order_line ON construction.order_ref = order_line.order_ref AND construction.line_ref = order_line.line_no
JOIN dress_order ON dress_order.order_no = order_line.order_ref
JOIN material ON order_line.ol_material = material.material_no

WHERE completed = 'Y' AND fabric = 'Silk'
